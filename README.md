# Wheel Constraint

## Overview
It is well known issue in Clarion programs: if a list control, combobox, or spinbox has a focus, the user can scroll it 
with the mouse wheel, even if the mouse cursor is outside of the control.
This behavior can be confusing.

Wheel Constraint is a template which allows a user to scroll list, combo, or spin controls by the wheel only if the mouse 
is over the control. Just add the global extension to your application, and the problem is solved.

## Features
- LIST, COMBO, SPIN controls are supported.

## Usage
- Register the template.
- Add the global extension.
- That's all.

## Requirements
- Clarion 6.3 and newer.
- ABC and Legacy template chains.
